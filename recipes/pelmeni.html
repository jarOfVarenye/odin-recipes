                        </ul>

                    <p>Dust a baking sheet lightly with 1 tablespoon flour; set aside.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Roll out a portion of dough very thinly on a lightly floured surface; keep remaining dough covered with a dish towel to avoid drying out.</li>
                        <li>Cut out 2 1/2-inch rounds with a cookie cutter.</li>
                        <li>Place about 1 teaspoon filling on one side of each dough circle.</li>
                        <li>Fold dough over and seal the edges using your fingers, forming a crescent.</li>

                        <li>Place on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
                        <li>Repeat with remaining dough and filling.</li>
                        <li>Freeze pelmeni for 30 minutes to prevent them from sticking together.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br>

                        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a simmer.</li>
                        <li>Working in batches, cook frozen pelmeni in simmering water until meat is cooked through and pelmeni float to the top, about 5 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Continue cooking for 5 more minutes.</li>
                        <li>Transfer to serving plates using a slotted spoon.</li>
